          <p>Eery shoot starts with some kind of inspiration; this time it was a location: Starbird, a reimagined fast food restaurant in Sunnyvale. The fresh, clean decor provided the perfect backdrop for a playful yet sophisticated editorial. Monochromatic palettes have favored black all through spring and summer, and now are shifting to all-white—even into fall. Each look is set apart by adding simple and geometric accessories that are easily layered without being overwhelming.</p>
          <p>Attending university is becoming less and less affordable. The skyrocketing tuition rates at American institutions render many families unable to support their children through college. Even families that are fairly stable financially are heavily impacted by their children’s college tuitions. Education is the key to a better future for every individual, and everyone deserves a fair shot at having a good education.</p>
